web-emoji
=========

No code here yet, working on cleaning it up!


This project brings emoji support for websites and mobile web application. 

The general idea is to let server-side code deal with all things unicode. The clients just pass over the emojis,
while the server replaces all üç∫ with :beer:. This makes it easier to store text in databases (no need to deal 
with utf8-mb4), and UTF-16 in JS for example.  

The clients are responsible for replacing :beer: with something that looks like a beer. In this case it's a <span>.

PHP
====
The PHP class supports conversion from emoji to :beer:, and from :beer: to HTML.

$e = new Emojificator('data/');
$e->emoji2text("Are you up for a üç∫?"); // Are you up for a :beer:?
$e->text2html("Are you up for a :beer:?"); // Are you up for a <span></span>

JavaScript
==========

Emoji.text2Html("Are you up for a :beer:?"); // Are you up for a <span></span>
